//! Coinbase note issuance — the one transparent seam (PLAN §2.7).
//!
//! Mining rewards are created from nothing, so a coinbase note has no input note
//! to prove. Instead it is a note commitment with a **publicly stated value** —
//! the block subsidy, which consensus checks against the emission schedule. The
//! coinbase transaction states the note's recipient and randomness publicly, so
//! consensus can **deterministically recompute** the note commitment and add it
//! to the global tree. After the miner spends it once (with a normal Orchard
//! proof) it is indistinguishable from any other note.
//!
//! ## Why this is sound
//!
//! For a *private* output, the value is hidden and is bound to the bundle by the
//! binding signature. A coinbase note is different: its value is **public**, and
//! consensus recomputes the commitment from `(recipient, value, ρ, rseed)`. The
//! commitment is a binding commitment to the value, so a miner cannot have the
//! recorded commitment open to anything other than the stated subsidy — there is
//! no freedom to mint extra value into the note. The subsidy enters the turnstile
//! accounting exactly once, as `cumulative_coinbase += subsidy` (§2.6).
//!
//! `ρ` (rho) must be unique per coinbase note so that the note's eventual
//! nullifier is unique; consensus derives it deterministically from the coinbase
//! transaction (e.g. its id), which this module treats as an opaque input.
